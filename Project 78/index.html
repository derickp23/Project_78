                    I didn't know where to go
                    Didn't know what I should see
                    So I left town
                    As soon as you left me
                    
                    Tried to find myself
                    Down in Tennessee
                    But you got away
                    With the best of me
                    
                    But now I do my best
                    And I'm barely getting by
                    This damn town never sleeps
                    Keeps me runnin' every night
                    
                    And now I do my best
                    And I'm barely getting by
                    This damn town never sleeps
                    Keeps me runnin' every night
                    
                    Thought I'd get by on my own
                    Thought I'd be what I want to be
                    Until you opened my eyes
                    And you made me see
                    
                    I'll just play these cards
                    'Til my time and money's gone
                    And I'll leave this world
                    With some simple songs
                    
                    But now I do my best
                    And I'm barely getting by
                    This damn town never sleeps
                    Keeps me runnin' every night
                    
                    And now I do my best
                    And I'm barely getting by
                    This damn town never sleeps
                    Keeps me runnin' every night</p>
